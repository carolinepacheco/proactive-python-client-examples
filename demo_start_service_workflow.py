"""
This script submits a PSA workflow from the ProActive catalog to the scheduler and retrieves its execution details.

Steps:
1. Initialize the ProActive gateway and REST API for interaction.
2. Ask the user for bucket and workflow name via command-line input.
3. Submit the workflow using `startPSAWorkflowFromCatalog()`, retrieving:
   - `job_id`: The submitted job ID.
   - `instance_id`: The created service instance ID.
   - `service_job_id`: The running serviceâ€™s job ID.
   - `endpoint`: The service endpoint URL.
   - `service_description`: Workflow metadata.
4. Check execution success:
   - Print job details if successful.
   - Display an error and exit if failed.
5. Close the connection to the ProActive Scheduler.

Ensures efficient workflow execution with structured error handling and resource management.
